This information tends to increase and is constantly updated continuously. For example, you can expose the address where you live, how often you are present (and absent) from your home, work or school. This sharing inadvertently facilitates those who have illicit plots to have information to plan a case. (theft, murder, rape ...)</li>
                                <li>- Many people use the internet easily to reveal information in their personal pages. Information that can be exposed such as email address, date of birth or phone number can cause you to be harassed, violated and impersonated online.</li>
                                <li>- Many people do not anticipate that once information is shared and exchanged online, it becomes public information. Even if only sharing status updates with one person or group of people, users cannot control what these people will do with that information. On the other hand, any information shared on the web can be considered public information and from where private information will be shared and disseminated.</li>
